"""Open teardrop polymer-clay cutter set: the classic drop earring with a matching
drop-shaped window, in three sizes with a pusher for each.

Press the cutter into rolled clay (2-3 mm), lift, and push the piece out with the
matching pusher. Each cutter has a flat back with a finger flange, a sharp single-line
edge, an inner blade that cuts the window out in the same press, and support bars across the back that sit well clear of the clay.
Prints edge-up with no supports on a Bambu A1 or A1 mini.

Spec:
  object:       polymer-clay cutter set, teardrop with a teardrop window cut out
  overall:      cut pieces 24, 32 and 40 mm on the longest side; cutters 6.7 mm larger
                (blade + flange), 12 mm tall; pushers 14.2 mm tall
  mates with:   its pusher: prongs 0.3 mm clear of every blade and bar per side
  orientation:  cutter back plane on the bed, cutting edge up; pusher plate down, prongs up;
                no supports
  must have:    teardrop outline, point up; teardrop window cut through, offset toward the round
                end; 0.45 mm cutting edge; finger flange 2 mm
  tolerances:   cut size +-0.3 mm; blade edge one 0.4 mm-nozzle line

Units: mm. Z is up. Don't scale the STL to resize (it changes blade thickness):
use --set sizes=22,30,38.
